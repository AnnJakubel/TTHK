            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Rammstein (German pronunciation: 
            [ˈʁamʃtaɪn], lit. "ramming stone") 
            is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed 
            in Berlin in 1994. The band's lineup—consisting 
            of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist 
            Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, 
            bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, 
            and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz—has remained 
            unchanged throughout their history, along with their 
            approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann 
            writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces 
            the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to 
            their formation, some members were associated with the 
            punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.</p>

            <p>Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within 
            the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album 
            leading the music press to coin the term, and their style 
            of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. 
            Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 
            1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries 
            around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature 
            pyrotechnics, have contributed to the growth in their popularity. 
            Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, 
            with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, 
            the song "Ich tu dir weh" forced its parent album Liebe ist 
            für alle da to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due 
            to its sexually explicit lyrics.</p>
