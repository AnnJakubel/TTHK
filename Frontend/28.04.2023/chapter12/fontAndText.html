            The <a class="breed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>
            or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog tradionally used
            as a herder and guardian of sheep.

        <h2>Breed History</h2>
        <p>
            The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic 
            region of north-central France, where it was traditionally used 
            both for herding sheep and to defend them. The first 
            written mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in 
            the Cours complet d'agriculture of Jean-Baptiste Fran√ßois Rozier,
             who in 1783 wrote that the "chien de Brie" was 
            long-haired and usually black;[a] that in the open plains there 
            was little danger from wolves, and so the dogs were used more for 
            herding than for defence.
